The integrated dishwasher, washer/dryer, oven and ceramic hob are from Beko, the microwave is Teka and the fridge/freezer is Electrolux - all highly efficient. Key in the design of the kitchen is its marriage of vintage and contemporary; it is aesthetically ' homely' and almost familiar while it celebrates and accommodates our more modern lifestyles.

The dining area enjoys the openness and flow from the kitchen while remaining its own intimate setting. The table is elegant with restaurant-style seating such that the space brings all the right majesty to meal-time aided by the luxurious charcoal chairs which really brings the table to life.

There is a dedicated work station to one side of the living area, private and secluded with a comfortable desk and chair, created with modern living in mind. Floor-to-ceiling sliding doors flood the room with natural light, leading out on to a large balcony which runs the width of the room.

The bedrooms are designed to champion downtime - each one a sanctuary of solitude and rest. Thick carpeting and a laid-back colour palette ensure that the rooms maintains their own relaxed atmosphere, separate to whatever hustle and bustle might lie beyond the door. The beds are large, very comfortable and low-standing, picking up the room' s subtle tones with an attractive wooden trim. This extends to the wardrobe, bedside lockers, chest of drawers and an elegant dressing table to complete the suite. Floor-length curtains will guarantee darkness when required, but the window is thoughtfully positioned to make the most of the morning light.

While each bedroom has been given its own unique interior design, they share a common aesthetic theme. The master features an ensuite bathroom with attractive wood-effect flooring and a large shower with marble wall-tiling. The uniqueness of Elmville is that the keen eye of the interior designer is evident throughout and the main bathroom is no exception.

The table is elegant with restaurant-style seating such that the space brings all the right majesty to meal-time aided by the bright pop of yellow chairs which really brings the table to life. The dining area leads on to the main living space where a large stylish rug creates a generous and airy openness among the seating, which includes a matching blue two-seater couch and armchair as well as a more minimalist and rather stylish mustard single-seater. There is a dedicated work station in the corner of the living area, private and secluded with a comfortable desk and chair, created with modern living in mind. Floor-to-ceiling sliding doors flood the room with natural light, leading out on to a large balcony which runs the length of the room.

The bedroom is designed to champion downtime - a sanctuary of solitude and rest. Thick carpeting and a laid-back colour palette ensure that the room maintains its own relaxed atmosphere, separate to whatever hustle and bustle might lie beyond the door. The bed is large, very comfortable and low-standing and picks up the room' s subtle tones with an attractive wooden trim. This extends to the wardrobe, bedside lockers, chest of drawers and an elegant dressing table to complete the suite. Floor-length curtains will guarantee darkness when required, but the window is thoughtfully positioned to make the most of the morning light.

The uniqueness of Elmville is that the keen eye of the interior designer is evident throughout and the bathroom is no exception. The large bath/shower delightfully features the notorious chic subway tiles, a long standing favourite in practical-meets-pleasing bathroom design. The apartment is fitted with an intercom system for permission of access from within. The home is heated using an air-source pump and heat-recovery unit, a sensible and modern solution - highly efficient with low running costs."
